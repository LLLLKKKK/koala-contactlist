Improvement for theteam's tech evaluation in cmpt470

## Introduction

Contact list was a project for CMPT470 of 2012 fall in SFU. It was developed by theteam, including Ye, Ryan, Diego and me. Contact list only has little function with little backend. Now, I want to improve it to make it powerful.

## Features

1. Backend is based on Node.js and Express 3.x
2. Mongodb for database and mongoose.js for object modeling
3. BDD with mocha and supertest
4. Frontend is based on Backbone.js, using Backbone-validation for data validation
